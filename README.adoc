[[introduction]]
== Introduction

This project is a http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot Starter] for Bucket4j.
It can be used limit the rate of access to your REST APIs.

* Prevention of DoS Attacks, brute-force logins attempts
* Request throttling for specific regions, unauthenticated users, authenticated users, not paying users.

The benefit of this project is the configuration of Bucket4j via Spring Boots *properties* or *yaml* files. You don't
have to write a single line of code.

[[migration_guide]]
== Migration Guide

This section is meant to help you migrate your application to new version of this starter project.

=== Spring Boot Starter Bucket4j 0.9

* Upgrade to Spring Boot 3
* Spring Boot 3 requires Java 17 so use at least Java 17
* Replaced Java 8 compatible Bucket4j dependencies
* Exclude example webflux-infinispan due to startup problems

=== Spring Boot Starter Bucket4j 0.8

==== Compatibility to Java 8

The version 0.8 tries to be compatible with Java 8 as long as Bucket4j is supporting Java 8. With the release
of Bucket4j 8.0.0 Bucket4j decided to migrate to Java 11 but provides dedicated artifacts for Java 8. 
The project is switching to the dedicated artifacts which supports Java 8. You can read more about
it https://github.com/bucket4j/bucket4j#java-compatibility-matrix[here]. 

==== Rename property expression to cache-key

The property *..rate-limits[0].expression* is renamed to *..rate-limits[0].cache-key*.
An Exception is thrown on startup if the *expression* property is configured.

To ensure that the property is not filled falsely the property is marked with *@Null*. This change requires 
a Bean Validation implementation.

==== JSR 380 - Bean Validation implementation required

To ensure that the Bucket4j property configuration is correct an Validation API implementation is required. 
You can add the Spring Boot Starter Validation which will automatically configures one.

==== Explicit Configuration of the Refill Speed - API Break

The refill speed of the Buckets can now configured explicitly with the Enum RefillSpeed. You can choose between 
a greedy or interval refill see the https://bucket4j.com/8.1.1/toc.html#refill[official documentation].

Before 0.8 the refill speed was configured implicitly by setting the fixed-refill-interval property explicit.

[source, properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].bandwidths[0].fixed-refill-interval=0
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].bandwidths[0].fixed-refill-interval-unit=minutes
----

These properties are removed and replaced by the following configuration:

[source, properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].bandwidths[0].refill-speed=interval
----

You can read more about the refill speed configuration here <<refill_speed>>

[[getting_started]]
== Getting started

To use the rate limit in your project you have to add the Bucket4j Spring Boot Starter dependency in 
your project. Additionally you have to choose a caching provider <<cache_overview>>.

The next example uses https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR 107] Ehcache which will be auto configured with the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-caching.html[Spring Boot Starter Cache].

	<artifactId>ehcache</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

> Don't forget to enable the caching feature by adding the @EnableCaching annotation to any of the configuration classes.

The configuration can be done in the application.properties / application.yml. 
The following configuration limits all requests independently from the user. It allows a maximum of 5 requests within 10 seconds independently from the user.


[source,yml]
----
bucket4j:
  enabled: true
  filters:
  - cache-name: buckets
    url: .*
    rate-limits:
    - bandwidths:
      - capacity: 5
        time: 10
        unit: seconds
----

For Ehcache 3 you also need a *ehcache.xml* which can be placed in the classpath.
The configured cache name *buckets* must be defined in the configuration file.   

[source,yml]
----
spring:
  cache:
    jcache:
      config: classpath:ehcache.xml
----

Instead of determine the Caching Provider by the Bucket4j Spring Boot Starter project you can implement the SynchCacheResolver 
or the AsynchCacheResolver by yourself.

You can enable the cache auto configuration explicitly by using the *cache-to-use* property name or setting 
it to an invalid value to disable all auto configurations.

[[filters]]
== Filter

=== Filter strategy

The filter strategy defines how the execution of the rate limits will be performed.

[source, properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].strategy=first # [first, all]
----

==== first

The *first* is the default strategy. This the default strategy which only executes one rate limit configuration.

==== all

The *all* strategy executes all rate limit independently. 

[[cache_key]]
== Cache Key

To differentiate incoming request you can provide an expression which is used as a key resolver for the underlying cache.

The expression uses the https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html[Spring Expression Language] (SpEL) which
provides the most flexible solution to determine the cache key written in one line of code. https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html#expressions-spel-compilation[The expression compiles to a Java class which will be used].

Depending on the filter method [servlet, webflux, gateway] different SpEL root objects can be used in the expression so that you have a direct access to the method of these request objects:

* servlet: jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest (e.g. getRemoteAddr() or getRequestURI())
* webflux: org.springframework.http.server.reactive.ServerHttpRequest
* gateway: org.springframework.http.server.reactive.ServerHttpRequest

The configured URL which is used for filtering is added to the cache-key to provide a unique cache-key for multiple URL.
You can read more about it https://github.com/MarcGiffing/bucket4j-spring-boot-starter/issues/19[here].

*Limiting based on IP-Address*:
[source]
----
getRemoteAddress()

*Limiting based on Username - If not logged in use IP-Address*:
[source]
----
@securityService.username()?: getRemoteAddr()
----
[source,java]
----
/**
* You can define custom beans like the SecurityService which can be used in the SpEl expressions.
**/
@Service
public class SecurityService {

	public String username() {
		String name = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getName();
		if(name == "anonymousUser") {
			return null;
		}
		return name;
	}
	
}
----

[[refill_speed]]
== Refill Speed

The refill speed defines the period of the regeneration of consumed tokens.
This starter supports two types of token regeneration. The refill speed can be set with the following 
property:

[source, properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].bandwidths[0].refill-speed=greedy # [greedy,interval]
----

* *greedy*: This is the default refill speed and tries to add tokens as soon as possible.
* *interval*: You can alternatively chose *interval* for the token regeneration which refills the token in a fixed interval.

You can read more about the refill speed in the https://bucket4j.com/8.1.1/toc.html#refill[official documentation].


[[skip_execution_predicates]]
== Skip and Execution Predicates (experimental)

Skip and Execution Predicates can be used to conditionally skip or execute the rate limiting. Each predicate has a unique name and a self-contained configuration.
The following section describes the build in Execution Predicates and how to use them.

=== Path Predicates

The Path Predicate takes a list of path parameters where any of the paths must match. 
See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/util/pattern/PathPattern.java[PathPattern] for the available configuration options. Segments are not evaluated further.

[source, properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].skip-predicates[0]=PATH=/hello,/world,/admin
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].execute-predicates[0]=PATH=/hello,/world,/admin
----
Matches the paths '/hello', '/world' or '/admin'.


=== Method Predicate

The Method Predicate takes a list of method parameters where any of the methods must match the used HTTP method.

----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].skip-predicates[0]=METHOD=GET,POST
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].execute-predicates[0]=METHOD=GET,POST
----
Matches if the HTTP method is 'GET' or 'POST'.

=== Query Predicate

The Query Predicate takes a single parameter to check for the existence of the query parameter.

----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].skip-predicates[0]=QUERY=PARAM_1
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].execute-predicates[0]=QUERY=PARAM_1
----
Matches if the query parameter 'PARAM_1' exists.

=== Header Predicate

The Header Predicate takes to parameters.

. First - The name of the Header Parameter which must match exactly
. Second - An optional regular expression where any existing header under the name must match

----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].execute-predicates[0]=Content-Type,.*PDF.*
----
Matches if the query parameter 'PARAM_1' exists.

=== Custom Predicate

You can also define you own Execution Predicate:

[source, java]
----
@Component
@Slf4j
public class MyQueryExecutePredicate extends ExecutePredicate<HttpServletRequest> {

	private String query;
	
	public String name() {
		// The name which can be used on the properties
		return "MY_QUERY";
	}

	public boolean test(HttpServletRequest t) {
	    // the logic to implement the predicate
		boolean result = t.getParameterMap().containsKey(query);
		log.debug("my-query-parametetr;value:%s;result:%s".formatted(query, result));
		return result;
	}

	public ExecutePredicate<HttpServletRequest> parseSimpleConfig(String simpleConfig) {
		// the configuration which is configured behind the equal sign
		// MY_QUERY=P_1 -> simpleConfig == "P_1"
		// 
		this.query = simpleConfig;
		return this;
	}
}
----

[[dynamic_config_updates]]
== Dynamically updating rate limits (experimental)
Sometimes it might be useful to modify filter configurations during runtime.
In order to support this behaviour a cache-based configuration update system has been added.
The following section describes what configurations are required to enable this feature.

=== Properties

==== base properties
In order to dynamically update rate limits, it is required to enable caching for filter configurations.
[source, properties]
----
bucket4j.filter-config-caching-enabled=true  #Enable/disable caching of filter configurations.
bucket4j.filter-config-cache-name=filterConfigCache #The name of the cache where the configurations are stored. Defaults to 'filterConfigCache'.
----

==== Filter properties
- When filter caching is enabled, it is mandatory to configure a unique id for every filter.
- Configurations are implicitly replaced based on a combination of the major and minor version. If changes are made to the configuration without increasing either of the version numbers, it is most likely that the changes will not be applied. Instead the cached configuration will be used.
[source, properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].id=filter1 #The id of the filter. This should always be a unique string.
bucket4j.filters[0].major-version=1 #[min = 1, max = 92 million] Major version number.
bucket4j.filters[0].minor-version=1 #[min = 1, max = 99 billion] Minor version number. (intended for internal updates, for example based on CPU-usage, but can also be used for regular updates)
----

==== RateLimit properties
For each ratelimit a tokens inheritance strategy can be configured. This strategy will determine how to handle existing rate limits when replacing a configuration. If no strategy is configured it will default to 'RESET'.

Further explanation of the strategies can be found at https://bucket4j.com/8.1.1/toc.html#tokensinheritancestrategy-explanation[Bucket4J TokensInheritanceStrategy explanation]

[source, properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].tokens-inheritance-strategy=RESET #[RESET, AS_IS, ADDITIVE, PROPORTIONALLY]
----

==== Bandwidth properties
This property is only mandatory when *BOTH* of the following statements apply to your configuration.

- The rate-limit uses a different TokensInheritanceStrategy than 'RESET'
- The rate-limit contains more than 1 bandwidth

This is required so Bucket4J knows how to map the current bandwidth tokens to the updated bandwidths.
It is possible to configure id's when 'RESET' strategy is applied, but the id's should still be unique within the rate-limit then.
[source, properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].bandwidths[0].id=bandwidthId #The id of the bandwidth; Optional when the rate-limit only contains 1 bandwidth or when using tokensInheritanceStrategy.RESET.
----

=== Example project
An example on how to dynamically update a filter can be found at:
{url-examples}/caffeine[Caffeine example project].

Some important considerations:

- This is an experimental feature and might be subject to changes.
- Configurations will be read from the cache during startup (when using a persistent cache). This means that putting corrupted configurations into the cache during runtime can cause the application to crash during startup.
- Most configuration errors can be prevented by using the Jakarta validator to validate updated configurations. In the example this is done by adding @Valid to the request body method parameter, but it is also possible to @Autowire the Validator and use it directly to validate the configuration.
- Some Filter properties are not intended to be modified during runtime. To simplify validating a configuration update the Bucket4JUtils.validateConfigurationUpdate method has been added. This method executes the following validations and will return a ResponseEntity:
** old configuration != null  -> NOT_FOUND
** new configuration has a higher version than the old configuration -> BAD_REQUEST
** filterMethod not changed -> BAD_REQUEST
** filterOrder not changed -> BAD_REQUEST
** cacheName not changed -> BAD_REQUEST
- The configCacheManager currently does *not* contain validation in the setValue method. The configuration should be validated before calling the this method.

[[monitoring]]
== Monitoring - Spring Boot Actuator

Spring Boot ships with a great support for collecting metrics. This project automatically provides metric information about the consumed and rejected buckets. You can extend these information with configurable https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_tag_naming[custom tags] like the username or the IP-Address which can then be evaluated in a monitoring system like prometheus/grafana.
