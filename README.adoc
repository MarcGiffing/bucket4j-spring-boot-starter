[[introduction]]
== Spring Boot Starter for Bucket4j

This project is a Spring Boot Starter for Bucket4j, allowing you to set access limits on your API effortlessly.
Its key advantage lies in the configuration via properties or yaml files, eliminating the need for manual code authoring.

Here are some example use cases:

* Preventing DoS Attacks
* Thwarting brute-force login attempts
* Implementing request throttling for specific regions, unauthenticated users, and authenticated users
* Applying rate limits for non-paying users or users with varying permissions

The project offers several features, some utilizing Spring's Expression Language for dynamic condition interpretation:

* Cache key for differentiate the by username, IP address, ...)
* Execution based on specific conditions
* Skipping based on specific conditions
* <<dynamic_config_updates>>
* Post-token consumption actions based on filter/method results

You have two options for rate limit configuration: adding a filter for incoming web requests or applying fine-grained control at the method level.

[[introduction_filter]]
=== Use Filter for rate limiting

Filters are customizable components designed to intercept incoming web requests, capable of rejecting requests to halt further processing.
You can incorporate multiple filters for various URLs or opt to bypass rate limits entirely for authenticated users.
When the limit is exceeded, the web request is aborted, and the client receives an HTTP Status 429 Too Many Requests error.

This projects supports the following filters:

* https://docs.oracle.com/javaee%2F6%2Fapi%2F%2F/javax/servlet/Filter.html[Servlet Filter] (Default)
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/server/WebFilter.html[Webflux Webfilter] (reactive)
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/spring-cloud-gateway/global-filters.html[Spring Cloud Gateway Global Filter] (reactive)

[[introduction_method]]
=== Use Annotations on methods for rate limiting

Utilizing the '@RateLimiting' annotation, AOP intercepts your method.
This grants you comprehensive access to method parameters, empowering you to define the rate limit key or conditionally skip rate limiting with ease.

==== Method Configuration

Bucket configuration is done in application.properties or application.yaml.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
bucket4j.methods[0].name=not_an_admin # the name of the configuration for annotation reference
bucket4j.methods[0].cache-name=buckets # the name of the cache
bucket4j.methods[0].rate-limits[0].bandwidths[0].capacity=5 # refills 5 tokens every 10 seconds (intervall)
bucket4j.methods[0].rate-limits[0].bandwidths[0].time=10

bucket4j.default-method-metric-tags[0].expression="@testServiceImpl.getRemoteAddr()" # reference to a bean method to fill the metric key
bucket4j.default-method-metric-tags[0].types[0]=REJECTED_COUNTER
bucket4j.default-method-metric-tags[0].types[1]=CONSUMED_COUNTER
bucket4j.default-method-metric-tags[0].types[2]=PARKED_COUNTER
bucket4j.default-method-metric-tags[0].types[3]=INTERRUPTED_COUNTER
bucket4j.default-method-metric-tags[0].types[4]=DELAYED_COUNTER
----

.application.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
bucket4j:
  methods:
    - name: not_an_admin # the name of the configuration for annotation reference
      cache-name: buckets # the name of the cache
      rate-limit:
        bandwidths:
          - capacity: 5 # refills 5 tokens every 10 seconds (intervall)
            time: 30
            unit: seconds
            refill-speed: interval
  default-method-metric-tags:
    - key: IP
      expression: "@testServiceImpl.getRemoteAddr()" # reference to a bean method to fill the metric key
      types:
        - REJECTED_COUNTER
        - CONSUMED_COUNTER
        - PARKED_COUNTER
        - INTERRUPTED_COUNTER
        - DELAYED_COUNTER
----

The in this example configuration referenced testServiceImpl is not part of bucket4j-spring-boot-starter.
If you would like to have the IP as metric tag you need to implement you own mechanism for that.

Working example for method annotation and IPs in metrics: {url-examples}/general-tests/src/main/java/com/giffing/bucket4j/spring/boot/starter/example/jedis-redis[jedis-redis Example project]

==== Method annotation

[source,java]
----
@RateLimiting(
            // reference to the property file
            name = "not_an_admin",
            // the rate limit is per user
            cacheKey= "#username",
            // only when the parameter is not admin
            executeCondition = "#username != 'admin'",
            // skip when parameter equals admin
            skipCondition = "#username eq 'admin",
            // the method name is added to the cache key to  prevent conflicts with other methods
            ratePerMethod = true,
            // if the limit is exceeded the fallback method is called. If not provided an exception is thrown
            fallbackMethodName = "myFallbackMethod")
    public String execute(String username) {
        log.info("Method with Param {} executed", username);
        return myParamName;
    }

    // the fallback method must have the same signature
    public String myFallbackMethod(String username) {
        log.info("Fallback-Method with Param {} executed", username);
        return myParamName;
    }
----

The '@RateLimiting' annotation on class level executes the rate limit on all public methods of the class.
With '@IgnoreRateLimiting' you can ignore the rate limit at all on class level or for specific method on method level.

[source,java]
----
@Component
@Slf4j
@RateLimiting(name = "default")
public class TestService {

    public void notAnnotatedMethod() {
        log.info("Method notAnnotatedMethod");
    }

    @IgnoreRateLimiting
    public void ignoreMethod() {
        log.info("Method ignoreMethod");
    }

}
----

==== Method dependencies

As the @RateLimiting mechanism uses AOP you need to ensure your spring-boot provides the necessary dependencies.

Just add

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-aop</artifactId>

[[refill_speed]]
==== Refill Speed

The refill speed defines the period of the regeneration of consumed tokens.
This starter supports two types of token regeneration.
The refill speed can be set with the following property:

[source,properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].bandwidths[0].refill-speed=greedy # [greedy,interval]
----

* *greedy*: This is the default refill speed and tries to add tokens as soon as possible.
* *interval*: You can alternatively chose *interval* for the token regeneration which refills the token in a fixed interval.

You can read more about the refill speed in the https://bucket4j.com/8.1.1/toc.html#refill[official documentation].

[[rate_limit_strategy]]
==== Rate Limit Strategy

If multiple rate limits are defined the strategy defines how many of them should be executed.

[source,properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].strategy=first # [first, all]
----

===== first

The *first* is the default strategy.
This the default strategy which only executes one rate limit configuration.
If a rate limit configuration is skipped due to the provided condition.
It does not count as an executed rate limit.

===== all

The *all* strategy executes all rate limit independently.

[[skip_execution_predicates]]
==== Skip and Execution Predicates (experimental)

Skip and Execution Predicates can be used to conditionally skip or execute the rate limiting.
Each predicate has a unique name and a self-contained configuration.
The following section describes the build in Execution Predicates and how to use them.

===== Path Predicates

The Path Predicate takes a list of path parameters where any of the paths must match.
See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/util/pattern/PathPattern.java[PathPattern] for the available configuration options.
Segments are not evaluated further.

[source,properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].skip-predicates[0]=PATH=/hello,/world,/admin
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].execute-predicates[0]=PATH=/hello,/world,/admin
----

Matches the paths '/hello', '/world' or '/admin'.

===== Method Predicate

The Method Predicate takes a list of method parameters where any of the methods must match the used HTTP method.

----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].skip-predicates[0]=METHOD=GET,POST
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].execute-predicates[0]=METHOD=GET,POST
----

Matches if the HTTP method is 'GET' or 'POST'.

===== Query Predicate

The Query Predicate takes a single parameter to check for the existence of the query parameter.

----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].skip-predicates[0]=QUERY=PARAM_1
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].execute-predicates[0]=QUERY=PARAM_1
----

Matches if the query parameter 'PARAM_1' exists.

===== Header Predicate

The Header Predicate takes to parameters.

. First - The name of the Header Parameter which must match exactly
. Second - An optional regular expression where any existing header under the name must match

----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].execute-predicates[0]=Content-Type,.*PDF.*
----

Matches if the query parameter 'PARAM_1' exists.

===== Custom Predicate

You can also define you own Execution Predicate:

[source,java]
----
@Component
@Slf4j
public class MyQueryExecutePredicate extends ExecutePredicate<HttpServletRequest> {

	private String query;

	public String name() {
		// The name which can be used on the properties
		return "MY_QUERY";
	}

	public boolean test(HttpServletRequest t) {
	    // the logic to implement the predicate
		boolean result = t.getParameterMap().containsKey(query);
		log.debug("my-query-parameter;value:%s;result:%s".formatted(query, result));
		return result;
	}

	public ExecutePredicate<HttpServletRequest> parseSimpleConfig(String simpleConfig) {
		// the configuration which is configured behind the equal sign
		// MY_QUERY=P_1 -> simpleConfig == "P_1"
		//
		this.query = simpleConfig;
		return this;
	}
}
----

[[cache_key_filter]]
=== Cache Key for Filter

To differentiate incoming request (e.g. by IP address) you can provide an expression which is used as a key resolver for the underlying cache.

Depending on the filter method [servlet, webflux, gateway] different SpEL root objects can be used in the expression so that you have a direct access to the method of these request objects:

* servlet: jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest (e.g. getRemoteAddr() or getRequestURI())
* webflux: org.springframework.http.server.reactive.ServerHttpRequest
* gateway: org.springframework.http.server.reactive.ServerHttpRequest

The configured URL which is used for filtering is added to the cache-key to provide a unique cache-key for multiple URL.
You can read more about it https://github.com/MarcGiffing/bucket4j-spring-boot-starter/issues/19[here].

*Limiting based on IP-Address*:

[source]
----
getRemoteAddress()
----

*Limiting based on Username - If not logged in use IP-Address*:

[source]
----
@securityService.username()?: getRemoteAddr()
----

[source,java]
----
/**
* You can define custom beans like the SecurityService which can be used in the SpEl expressions.
**/
@Service
public class SecurityService {

	public String username() {
		String name = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getName();
		if(name.equals("anonymousUser")) {
			return null;
		}
		return name;
	}

}
----

[[post-execute-condition]]
=== Post Execution (Consume) Condition

If you define a post execution condition the available tokens are not consumed on a rate limit configuration execution.
It will only estimate the remaining available tokens.
Only if there are no tokens left the rate limit is applied by.
If the request was proceeded by the application we can check the return value check if the token should be consumed.

Example: You want to limit the rate only for unauthorized users.
You can't consume the available token for the incoming request because you don't know if the user will be authenticated afterward.
With the post execute condition you can check the HTTP response status code and only consume the token if it has the status Code 401 UNAUTHORIZED.

[[features]]
== Features

[[dynamic_config_updates]]
=== Dynamically updating rate limits (experimental)

Sometimes it might be useful to modify filter configurations during runtime.
In order to support this behaviour a cache-based configuration update system has been added.
The following section describes what configurations are required to enable this feature.

==== Properties

===== base properties

In order to dynamically update rate limits, it is required to enable caching for filter configurations.

[source,properties]
----
bucket4j.filter-config-caching-enabled=true  #Enable/disable caching of filter configurations.
bucket4j.filter-config-cache-name=filterConfigCache #The name of the cache where the configurations are stored. Defaults to 'filterConfigCache'.
----

===== Filter properties

- When filter caching is enabled, it is mandatory to configure a unique id for every filter.
- Configurations are implicitly replaced based on a combination of the major and minor version.
If changes are made to the configuration without increasing either of the version numbers, it is most likely that the changes will not be applied.
Instead the cached configuration will be used.

[source,properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].id=filter1 #The id of the filter. This should always be a unique string.
bucket4j.filters[0].major-version=1 #[min = 1, max = 92 million] Major version number.
bucket4j.filters[0].minor-version=1 #[min = 1, max = 99 billion] Minor version number. (intended for internal updates, for example based on CPU-usage, but can also be used for regular updates)
----

===== RateLimit properties

For each ratelimit a tokens inheritance strategy can be configured.
This strategy will determine how to handle existing rate limits when replacing a configuration.
If no strategy is configured it will default to 'RESET'.

Further explanation of the strategies can be found at https://bucket4j.com/8.1.1/toc.html#tokensinheritancestrategy-explanation[Bucket4J TokensInheritanceStrategy explanation]

[source,properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].tokens-inheritance-strategy=RESET #[RESET, AS_IS, ADDITIVE, PROPORTIONALLY]
----

===== Bandwidth properties

This property is only mandatory when *BOTH* of the following statements apply to your configuration.

- The rate-limit uses a different TokensInheritanceStrategy than 'RESET'
- The rate-limit contains more than 1 bandwidth

This is required so Bucket4J knows how to map the current bandwidth tokens to the updated bandwidths.
It is possible to configure id's when 'RESET' strategy is applied, but the id's should still be unique within the rate-limit then.

[source,properties]
----
bucket4j.filters[0].rate-limits[0].bandwidths[0].id=bandwidthId #The id of the bandwidth; Optional when the rate-limit only contains 1 bandwidth or when using tokensInheritanceStrategy.RESET.
----

==== Example project

An example on how to dynamically update a filter can be found at:
{url-examples}/caffeine[Caffeine example project].

Some important considerations:

- This is an experimental feature and might be subject to changes.
- Configurations will be read from the cache during startup (when using a persistent cache).
This means that putting corrupted configurations into the cache during runtime can cause the application to crash during startup.
- Most configuration errors can be prevented by using the Jakarta validator to validate updated configurations.
In the example this is done by adding @Valid to the request body method parameter, but it is also possible to @Autowire the Validator and use it directly to validate the configuration.
- Some Filter properties are not intended to be modified during runtime.
To simplify validating a configuration update the Bucket4JUtils.validateConfigurationUpdate method has been added.
This method executes the following validations and will return a ResponseEntity:
** old configuration != null  -> NOT_FOUND
** new configuration has a higher version than the old configuration -> BAD_REQUEST
** filterMethod not changed -> BAD_REQUEST
** filterOrder not changed -> BAD_REQUEST
** cacheName not changed -> BAD_REQUEST
- The configCacheManager currently does *not* contain validation in the setValue method.
The configuration should be validated before calling the this method.

[[monitoring]]
=== Monitoring - Spring Boot Actuator

Spring Boot ships with a great support for collecting metrics.
This project automatically provides metric information about the consumed and rejected buckets.
You can extend these information with configurable https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_tag_naming[custom tags] like the username or the IP-Address which can then be evaluated in a monitoring system like prometheus/grafana.

[source,yml]
----
bucket4j:
  enabled: true
  filters:
  - cache-name: buckets
    filter-method: servlet
    filter-order: 1
    url: .*
    metrics:
      tags:
        - key: IP
          expression: getRemoteAddr()
          types: REJECTED_COUNTER # for data privacy reasons the IP should only be collected on bucket rejections
        - key: USERNAME
          expression: "@securityService.username() != null ? @securityService.username() : 'anonym'"
        - key: URL
          expression: getRequestURI()
    rate-limits:
      - execute-condition:  "@securityService.username() == 'admin'"
        cache-key: "@securityService.username()?: getRemoteAddr()"
        bandwidths:
        - capacity: 30
          time: 1
          unit: minutes

[[appendix]]
== Appendix

[[migration_guide]]
=== Migration Guide

This section is meant to help you migrate your application to new version of this starter project.

==== Spring Boot Starter Bucket4j 0.12

* Removed deprecated 'bucket4j.filters[x].rate-limits[x].expression' property.
Use 'bucket4j.filters[x].rate-limits[x].cache-key' instead.
* three new metric counter are added per default (PARKED, INTERRUPTED and DELAYED)

==== Spring Boot Starter Bucket4j 0.9

* Upgrade to Spring Boot 3
* Spring Boot 3 requires Java 17 so use at least Java 17
* Replaced Java 8 compatible Bucket4j dependencies
* Exclude example webflux-infinispan due to startup problems

==== Spring Boot Starter Bucket4j 0.8

===== Compatibility to Java 8

The version 0.8 tries to be compatible with Java 8 as long as Bucket4j is supporting Java 8. With the release of Bucket4j 8.0.0 Bucket4j decided to migrate to Java 11 but provides dedicated artifacts for Java 8.
The project is switching to the dedicated artifacts which supports Java 8. You can read more about it https://github.com/bucket4j/bucket4j#java-compatibility-matrix[here].

===== Rename property expression to cache-key

The property *..rate-limits[0].expression* is renamed to *..rate-limits[0].cache-key*.
An Exception is thrown on startup if the *expression* property is configured.

To ensure that the property is not filled falsely the property is marked with *@Null*.
This change requires a Bean Validation implementation.

===== JSR 380 - Bean Validation implementation required

To ensure that the Bucket4j property configuration is correct an Validation API implementation is required.
You can add the Spring Boot Starter Validation which will automatically configures one.

===== Explicit Configuration of the Refill Speed - API Break

The refill speed of the Buckets can now configured explicitly with the Enum RefillSpeed.
You can choose between a greedy or interval refill see the https://bucket4j.com/8.1.1/toc.html#refill[official documentation].

Before 0.8 the refill speed was configured implicitly by setting the fixed-refill-interval property explicit.

[source,properties]

|===

Instead of determine the Caching Provider by the Bucket4j Spring Boot Starter project you can implement the SynchCacheResolver or the AsynchCacheResolver by yourself.

You can enable the cache auto configuration explicitly by using the *cache-to-use* property name or setting it to an invalid value to disable all auto configurations.

[[property_configuration_examples]]
=== Property Configuration Examples

Simple configuration to allow a maximum of 5 requests within 10 seconds independently from the user.

[source,yml]
----
bucket4j:
  enabled: true
  filters:
  - cache-name: buckets
    url: .*
    rate-limits:
      - bandwidths:
        - capacity: 5
          time: 10
          unit: seconds
----

Conditional filtering depending of anonymous or logged in user.
Because the *bucket4j.filters[0].strategy* is *first*
you don't have to check in the second rate-limit that the user is logged in.
Only the first one is executed.

[source,yml]
----
bucket4j:
  enabled: true
  filters:
  - cache-name: buckets
    filter-method: servlet
    url: .*
    rate-limits:
      - execute-condition:  @securityService.notSignedIn() # only for not logged in users
        cache-key: "getRemoteAddr()"

          time: 1
          unit: minutes
      - execute-condition: "@securityService.username() != 'admin'" # strategy is only evaluate first. so the user must be logged in and user is not admin
        cache-key: @securityService.username()

        - capacity: 1000000000
          time: 1
          unit: minutes
----

Configuration of multiple independently filters (servlet|gateway|webflux filters) with specific rate limit configurations.

[source,yml]
----
bucket4j:
  enabled: true
  filters: # each config entry creates one servlet filter or other filter
  - cache-name: buckets # create new servlet filter with bucket4j configuration

        unit: seconds
  - cache-name: buckets
    url: /public*
    rate-limits:
      - cache-key: getRemoteAddress() # IP based filter
        bandwidths: # maximum of 5 requests within 10 seconds

        cache-key: "@securityService.username()?: getRemoteAddr()" # use the username as key. if authenticated use the ip address
        bandwidths:
        - capacity: 100
